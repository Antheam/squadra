# Squadra
A company's best asset is their people and with 90% of new starters making a decision whether to stay at a business within the first 6 months the onboarding process is critical to get every employee settled in, building relationships and becoming productive as soon as possible. 

Squadra is a free web app to help you automate onboarding while avoiding.. the boredom of repeating the same old office tour or overused, awkward icebreakers.

This app was a 5 day project built as part of the Flatiron London intensive web development bootcamp.

## Demo
Check out the app here: https://squadra-project.herokuapp.com/about

Note - first page load may take ~10 seconds due to use of a non-premium Heroku account. After initial load delay should be negligible.

## Key Features
üé® Create a set of fully custom onboarding questions (text or multiple choice supported) that are unique to your company culture and get your employees to open up and express themselves

üí¨ Every new employee is automatically introduced to your team on Slack with the answers to your onboarding questions, ensuring every employee gets to know a little bit more about their latest colleague. 

üòÑ Add fun to your onboarding process

üéÆ Dynamic quizzes based on custom questions set up by companies and employees responses - see who well you really know your team and encourage team bonding over shared interests

üîê Uses BCrypt to ensure secure and hashed storage of sensitive data

‚≠ê Newest employees automatically featured on the company homepage

üì±Designed to resize perfectly to any device to suit a modern workforce
